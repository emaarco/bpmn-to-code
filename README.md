# üöÄ bpmn-to-code

bpmn-to-code is a Maven and Gradle plugin designed to simplify process automation.
Its vision is to foster clean & robust solutions for BPMN-based process automation.
Therefore, it aims to provide a range of features ‚Äî
such as generating API definition files from BPMN process models ‚Äî
to reduce manual effort, simplify testing, promote the creation of clean process models,
and ensure consistency between your BPMN model and your code.

## **ü§©** What it can do for you

**Streamlined Process Automation**

Say goodbye to the tedious task of manually referencing BPMN elements. bpmn-to-code automatically extracts key
details‚Äîlike element IDs, messages, and worker types‚Äîand generates a lightweight ‚Äú**Process API**‚Äù that keeps your
process models and code in sync.

**Java & Kotlin Code Generation**

Whether you‚Äôre developing in **Java** or **Kotlin**, our plugin creates ready-to-use API definitions that integrate
seamlessly with your testing frameworks, messaging systems, or any other automation logic.

**Engine Agnostic & Extensible**

Currently, bpmn-to-code supports both **Camunda** 7 and **Zeebe**. Built with extensibility in mind, it is designed so
that adding support for additional process engines is straightforward‚Äîif there is enough demand.

**Styleguide Validation** (üöß)

Looking ahead, I‚Äôm planing a styleguide validation feature. Much like a linter for code, it will analyze your BPMN
models against your custom style guide - ensuring that element IDs, message names, and task types adhere to predefined
patterns and naming conventions. This will help maintain designs that are as clean and consistent as your code.

## üí° Process-API generation in action

The key feature of bpmn-to-code is generating a lightweight ‚ÄúProcess API‚Äù for your BPMN models.
Let‚Äôs say you have a newsletter subscription workflow (BPMN) that looks like this:

<img src="docs/example-process.png" alt="Example Process" width="800"/>

After running bpmn-to-code, you‚Äôll have a Kotlin (or Java) file that programmatically references your process model. For
example:

```kotlin
// Generated by bpmn-to-code
@file:Suppress("unused")

package de.emaarco.example

import kotlin.String
import kotlin.Suppress

object NewsletterSubscriptionProcessApiV1 {
    val PROCESS_ID: String = "newsletterSubscription"

    object Elements {
        val Timer_EveryDay: String = "Timer_EveryDay"
        val Timer_After3Days: String = "Timer_After3Days"
        val ErrorEvent_InvalidMail: String = "ErrorEvent_InvalidMail"
        val Activity_ConfirmRegistration: String = "Activity_ConfirmRegistration"
        val SubProcess_Confirmation: String = "SubProcess_Confirmation"
        val EndEvent_RegistrationAborted: String = "EndEvent_RegistrationAborted"
        val EndEvent_SubscriptionConfirmed: String = "EndEvent_SubscriptionConfirmed"
        val EndEvent_RegistrationCompleted: String = "EndEvent_RegistrationCompleted"
        val EndEvent_RegistrationNotPossible: String = "EndEvent_RegistrationNotPossible"
        val Activity_AbortRegistration: String = "Activity_AbortRegistration"
        val Activity_SendWelcomeMail: String = "Activity_SendWelcomeMail"
        val Activity_SendConfirmationMail: String = "Activity_SendConfirmationMail"
        val StartEvent_SubmitRegistrationForm: String = "StartEvent_SubmitRegistrationForm"
        val StartEvent_RequestReceived: String = "StartEvent_RequestReceived"
    }

    object Messages {
        val Message_FormSubmitted: String = "Message_FormSubmitted"
        val Message_SubscriptionConfirmed: String = "Message_SubscriptionConfirmed"
    }

    object TaskTypes {
        val EndEvent_RegistrationCompleted: String = "newsletter.registrationCompleted"
        val Activity_AbortRegistration: String = "newsletter.abortRegistration"
        val Activity_SendWelcomeMail: String = "newsletter.sendWelcomeMail"
        val Activity_SendConfirmationMail: String = "newsletter.sendConfirmationMail"
    }

    object Timers {
        val Timer_EveryDay: BpmnTimer = BpmnTimer("Duration", "PT1M")
        val Timer_After3Days: BpmnTimer = BpmnTimer("Duration", "PT2M30S")

        data class BpmnTimer(
            val type: String,
            val timerValue: String,
        )
    }

    object Errors {
        val Error_InvalidMail: BpmnError = BpmnError("Error_InvalidMail", "500")

        data class BpmnError(
            val name: String,
            val code: String,
        )
    }

    object Signals {
        val Signal_RegistrationNotPossible: String = "Signal_RegistrationNotPossible"
    }
}
```

All you need is a simple Gradle task configuration that specifies **where** your BPMN models reside,
**where** to output the generated API files, **which** language (Java or Kotlin) to generate,
and **which** process engine your models target (e.g., Camunda 7 or Zeebe):

```kotlin
tasks.named("generateBpmnModelApi", GenerateBpmnModelsTask::class) {
    baseDir = projectDir.toString()
    filePattern = "src/main/resources/**/*.bpmn"
    outputFolderPath = "$projectDir/src/main/kotlin"
    packagePath = "de.emaarco.example"
    outputLanguage = OutputLanguage.KOTLIN
    processEngine = ProcessEngine.ZEEBE
    useVersioning = false
}
```

Once configured, **bpmn-to-code** automatically picks up your BPMN files and generates convenient,
type-safe references you can use throughout your application‚Äîbe it for testing, messaging,
or worker definitions.

## üì¶ Structure

bpmn-to-code is available for both Gradle and Maven.
